# storydb : The story of how I made a database

## What is storydb?
storydb is a database that I made for fun, to contain my ideas for stories and for coherent worldbuilding.
It is a database that is meant to be used by a single person, and is not meant to be used by multiple people at once 
in its current state. Later on, I might add support for multiple users, but for now, it is a single-user database.

## How do I use storydb?
Through a simple user interface with a frontend and a backend. The frontend is written with streamlit, and the backend
is written with python, using MongoDB.
